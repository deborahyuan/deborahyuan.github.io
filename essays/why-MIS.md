I decided to take ITM 352 because I have always been interested in learning more about coding, especially in the context of business. 

From a young age, I was interested in Computer Science. However, when it came to declaring a major for college, I was hesitant to fully commit to Computer Science. I was worried that majoring in Computer Science would require excellent math skills, which I felt I was lacking in. After starting off as a Marketing major, I decided to add on another major, International Business. Going into my third year of college, I realized that I had enough time to fit a third major. I decided on MIS, because it is a combination of something I have always been interested in, Computer Science, and something a bit more practical, Business. 

I plan on majoring in MIS to aid not only my future career plans and goals, but also to contribute to personal learning and growth. I am looking to find a future career at a tech company or a startup, where I can utilize the skills that I have learned and honed while obtaining a degree in MIS. I also strongly believe that coding and technological literacy is increasingly important in our present tech-centric society. Regardless of whether one wishes to start up their own business, work for someone else or another company, or even simply access a website as a consumer, knowing HTML and JavaScript has its uses. In addition, learning one coding language will also make the process of learning a new language much easier, so the option is open to me in the future if need be.

Lastly, I believe that my first major, Marketing, synergizes well with MIS. By using the skills I have acquired through MIS, I will be able to build and construct websites that fulfill the goals of a particular marketing campaign. Being aware of the client-side tools that are available to me as a marketer allows for a more creative execution and implementation of marketing campagins. 

All in all, I am excited to see how my skills in coding and logical thinking abilities will develop as the semester progresses. These skills will be applicable not only in my future career, but also in my daily life.
