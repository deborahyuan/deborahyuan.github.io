I decided to take ITM 352 because I have always been interested in learning more about coding, especially in the context of business. From a young age, I was interested in Computer Science. However, when it came to declaring a major for college, I was hesitant to fully commit to Computer Science. I was worried that majoring in Computer Science would require excellent math skills, which I felt I was lacking in. After starting off as a Marketing major, I decided to add on another major, International Business. Going into my third year of college, I realized that I had enough time to fit a third major. I decided on MIS, because it is a combination of something I have always been interested in, Computer Science, and something a bit more practical, Business. I plan on majoring in MIS to aid not only my future career plans and goals, but also to contribute to personal learning and growth. I am looking to find a future career at a tech company or a startup, where I can utilize the skills that I have learned and honed while obtaining a degree in MIS.
