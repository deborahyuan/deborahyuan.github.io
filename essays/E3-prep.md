**Summary**

In this essay, I will be detailing my experiences with the three WODs I have done since the last technical essay. In BrowserHistory6, the WOD covered creating buttons that were clickable and also had a reaction when moused over; this WOD built off of the webpage made in BrowserHistory3, a previous WOD. SmartPhoneProducts1 with Variables went over the usage of variables rather than hardcoding information, building off of SmartPhoneProducts1 that we did in a Lab earlier in the semester. Lastly, Invoice1 had extensive usage of variables, using variables to store information about prices, quantities, tax rate and tax values, subtotals, and more. 

**BrowserHistory6**

1st attempt: ~36 minutes - Sd

I think I struggled the most with BrowserHistory6 out of the three WODs. What helped me with this WOD was that we had already somewhat explored onmouseover and onclick through our labs in class, so I could easily understand the code. The part I had the greatest difficulty with was finding out how to reference the pictures in the onmouseover event. I had originally set the img src to something like "firefox.png," but even after refreshing multiple times, I couldn't get the code to work and it was pretty frustrating. My workaround for this was simply to click on the link on the website that led to the individual Firefox webpage, copy the image's link address, then reference that in my code. Another thing that I had an issue with was getting my icons to shift the text downward rather than pushing it to the side upon an onmouseover event. After I watched the professor's video, I still couldn't figure out how to fix my code or even find the source of the issue. Other than that, I think the WOD was pretty straightforward. 

**SmartPhoneProducts1 with Variables**

1st attempt: ~11 minutes - Rx

Honestly, I found SmartPhoneProducts1 with Variables to be the easiest WOD out of the three. Most of the WOD was just assigning values to variables, which we had practiced extensively in our labs. I found that the suggestion in the instructions to use " .* " really helped with mass-replacing old code. I would say the most difficult part of this lab was simply catching mistakes. I had an issue where I forgot to change the code for one part, so my images weren't loading in properly; however, that issue was easily resolved. My advice: go through the code with a fine-toothed comb, especially when it comes to edits that involve replacing old code.

**Invoice1**

1st attempt: ~30 minutes - Av

Lastly, for BrowserHistory3, I also DNFed one time. In my opinion, this was the most complicated WOD to do thus far. Although I had read the instructions beforehand, I had no idea how to put the browser paragraph contents into three separate columns. Despite trying for 20 minutes, I couldnâ€™t figure it out. After attempting myself and failing, I then watched the professor do it. I found the screencast to be extremely helpful, but I did have to watch certain parts of the video again to figure out the exact steps. Combing through the video and following along in VS code helped a lot with retaining the different steps to creating the columns. Afterward, I redid the WOD and ended up with a really great time (9 minutes and 26 seconds)  that was better than average.

**Advice/Conclusion**

Overall, I felt that this round of WODs were much easier compared to the first three. I feel as if my ability to process how to use coding language to produce a result has improved significantly since the start of this semester.
