I went into BrowserHistory1 having watched the video on why and what a WOD sought to achieve by using an Athletic Approach. My strategy for approaching WODs was to read the instructions first and google everything I didn’t know or remember how to do beforehand. I thought that would be a better strategy than “peeking” at the answers provided by the instructor’s sample screencast. For example, prior to attempting BrowserHistory1, I looked up how to hyperlink both external websites and internal sections because I had forgotten. By combing through the instructions beforehand and making sure I understood what the WOD was asking for, I was able to go through the first WOD the first time, achieving an Average time. I did have some issues along the way, like forgetting how to put an image in an html, but overall, I did fine. I then watched the instructor’s screencast, and saw that I pretty much did exactly what the professor did, but all on my own, which made me feel quite accomplished.

In comparison, I think that I had a much more difficult time when it became to BrowserHistory2.
